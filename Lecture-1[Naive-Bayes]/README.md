# Naive Bayes
It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as ‘Naive’.

Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.

### Project Description :

We have emails from two persons. We are going to identify who will be the author of emails, using Naive Bayes Classification. So we have bunch of emails from person1 and same with person2 and we have predicted who is the author of an unseen email.

### Let's code
Naive Bayes predictions in text classifier. This code will be using scikit-learn, so if you dont know sklearn, then no need to worry. You can learn and understand code at <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/">Sklearn Documentation</a>

Create and train a Naive Bayes classifier in <a href="https://github.com/bodhwani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Assignments/naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py">nb_author_id.py</a>. Use it to make predictions for the test set. What is the accuracy?<br>

Go to the _Solution directory and run  <a href="https://github.com/bodhwani/Machine-Learning/blob/master/_Solutions/naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py">nb_author_id.py</a> script to match your result.
